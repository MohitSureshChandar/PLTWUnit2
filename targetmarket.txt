FortunesRocks,my family enjoys taking snacks to work that are easy to grab on the go we have tried different brands of trail mix but have found that this has the best combination and is always fresh
Unhappy,was eating a trail mix bag when i noticed a few of the peanuts had some white webbing (as seen in the picture of the peanut on the left side  there were several others too) loose in the bag and in the webbing were some darker brown specks all of the same size upon dumping the remainder of the trail mix baggie along with 3 other trail mix baggies for comparison the brown specks were unique to the webbed peanut bag the specks appeared to be either bug eggs or some critter's excrement not sure which is worse! had three other people verify the contents will never eat these again and do not recommend anyone else to eat these i contacted walmart and they did nothing be careful what you eat  it may be bug stuff from a filthy facility

rita,i haven't been buying the great value mountain trail mix for very long i haven't eaten any other brands of trail mix i like this and i'm stuck on it those little individual bags just hit the spot
Chelsea,we keep these at our house for snacks breakfast on the run and sweet cravings great for grab and go great price thank you walmart for giving us good fun snacks that we actually want to eat
Kell,i thorally enjoyed this trail mix the bags where the perfect snack size there was just enough of each thing in each bag will be buying them again
April,most of the mix is very tasty but a lot of the raisins have a weird taste to them one actually tasted rotten i'd prefer a mix without the raisins
PickyShopper3229,they call it trail mix but unless you like all peanuts with almost no almonds or cashews you might want to choose a different trail mix i was very disappointed to find almonds in 4 out of 8 bags and cashews in 3 out of 8 bag and only 2 bags had bothand even then there were only 2 or 3  but there were plenty of peanuts
Mia,the mix ratio was terrible some bags had maybe 4 m%26m's in them but each bag had 1000's of raisins

Mary,i buy this trail mix weekly the past 2 times i noticed the raisins are huge they are 4xs bigger than they use to be (normal raisins) almost the size of prunes not consistent quality
Shopper,too much salt vs sweetness ratio balance too many peanut chunks 1 almond a couple m%26m's %26 a couple raisins so it was a bit bland i wish there were more of a balance as i prefer a 50/50 blend of salty %26 sweet $598 for an 8 pack is a bit high for what you get
Uncancelled,these were a gift to be used for lunch boxes  and they are greatly enjoyed!

Lisa,my grandson loves these
lisa,nice snack
Howard,it is very tasty a mix with just enough sweet
Delecia,i like that it is delicious
Momto1,love this mix over the sweet and salty mix because i don't care for seeds like the other brand has and i like the almonds and cashews this one offers the problem i am having is i get 1 or 2 almonds and some cashew pieces the rest is all peanuts and raisins the ration in the mix is poor if you buy this expecting almonds and cashews its a bit disappointing
Marlynn,i like the bags the groceries cam in
yummy,this i bought for a pick up snack when your on the go and need a quick pick me upit's a snack just to satisfy your need without over doing ithighly recommended
Grandma3Sherry,good mix for a handy snack purchased for my hubby to keep in his truck he took them right out to his ride so i didn't get to taste them
TSR,overall i would say that the proportions of the items in the mix are good although there is a lot of raisins
Disappointed,trail mix is good enough but we were shorted one in the box informed company and they didn't do a thing about it
Emily,one of the 8 bags wasn't sealed and there was trail mix loose in the box other than that the mix itself is good
Kathy,great snack for kids or adults
Florida,good snack and you can't beat the price
